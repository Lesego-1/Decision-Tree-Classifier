# Decision Tree Classifier on Breast Cancer Dataset

# Introduction

This project involves building a Decision Tree classifier to predict breast cancer based on various features. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Dataset from the sklearn module.

### Dataset

The dataset contains 30 features. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

# Steps Involved

1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing and Visualization
3. Model Building and Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid Search
4. Model Evaluation and Cross-Validation
5. Error Analysis and Feature Importance
6. Visualization of Decision Tree and Results

# Results

The best Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy of 92.98% on the test set. The most important features contributing to the model's decisions were: [mean concave points, worst concave points, worst texture].

# Conclusion

The Decision Tree classifier provided insights into the significant features for predicting breast cancer.
